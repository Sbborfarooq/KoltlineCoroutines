Coroutines and Dispatchers
Coroutines:

Coroutines are a modern way to handle asynchronous programming in Kotlin, allowing you to write non-blocking code that is easier to read and maintain.
They enable concurrent execution of tasks, which helps keep your app responsive and smooth.
Dispatchers:

Dispatchers.Main:

When a coroutine runs on Dispatchers.Main, it is executing on the main thread (UI thread).
This is where you should perform UI updates and interact with UI components.
Since the main thread is responsible for handling user interactions and rendering the UI,
long-running tasks should not be executed here to avoid freezing the app.
Dispatchers.IO:

When a coroutine runs on Dispatchers.IO, it is executing on a background thread optimized for I/O operations.
This is suitable for tasks like network requests, file reading/writing, or database operations.
Using Dispatchers.IO allows you to perform these potentially long-running tasks without blocking the main thread, keeping the UI responsive.
Dispatchers.Default:

When a coroutine runs on Dispatchers.Default, it is also executing on a background thread but is optimized for CPU-intensive tasks.
This is suitable for tasks that require significant processing power, such as complex calculations or data processing.
Like Dispatchers.IO, using Dispatchers.Default helps ensure that the main thread remains free for UI interactions.
Summary
Main Thread: Use Dispatchers.Main for UI-related tasks.
Background Threads: Use Dispatchers.IO for I/O operations and Dispatchers.Default for CPU-intensive tasks.
Concurrency: Coroutines allow you to run multiple tasks concurrently, improving the performance and responsiveness of your application.
By using coroutines and the appropriate dispatchers, you can effectively manage background tasks in your Android application, leading to a smoother user experience
